# TMS1000

This is an implementation of the Texas Instrumens TMS1000 and TMS1100 in an
FPGA. The board being used here is an iceFUN with a Lattice iCE40 HX8K FPGA.

The original CPU runs 6 cycles per instruction, but this one is 3.
This can be compensated for by slowing the clock down.

Registers
=========

TMS1000 and TMS1100 have the following registers:

    A: 4 bit
    Y: 4 bit
    X: 2 bit on TMS1000 and 3 bit on TMS1100

For accessing RAM, the XY registers are combined to create a pointer
to RAM. So to access the nybble at location 0x18, X would be loaded with
0x1 and Y would be loaded with 0x8.

For loading instructions out of RAM there are 3 registers:

   PC: 6 bit
   PA: 4 bit (page address, called page in the Verilog)
   CA: 1 bit (chapter address, called chapter in the Verilog)

There is also a status register which, depending on the instruction will
be used as a carry flag, a not equal flag, or set to 1. All instructions
will change the flag. Again, if it's not valid for the instruction it's
always set to 1.

To save context when using the "call" function, there are some extra
registers:

    SR: Saved value of PC before subroutine call.
    PB: Saved PA (page) value before subroutine call.
    CB: Saved CA (chapter) value before subroutine call.
    CL: Call latch which is set when in a subroutine to protect SR, PB.
    CS: Chapter subroutine.

The PC (program counter) in the TMS1000 series doesn't increment by 1.
Instead it uses an LFSR (linear feedback shift register) algorithm.
Some sample code to show how it works in Python3 is in tools/pc_calc.py.
The algorithm here basically is:

    If PC is currently 0x1f: PC = (PC << 1) | 1
    If PC is currently 0x3f: PC = (PC << 1) | 0
                       Else: PC = (PC << 1) | ~(PC[bit5] ^ PC[bit4])

On reset, the PC will be 0, PB (page) will be 0xf.

Memories
========

TMS1000
-------

    ROM: 1024 bytes (8 bit)
    RAM: 64 nybbles (4 bit)

TMS1100
-------

    ROM: 2048 bytes  (8 bit)
    RAM: 128 nybbles (4 bit)

I/O
===

Input
-----

There are 4 pins for input K1, K2, K3, K4.

Output
------

There are two output ports that are very different in function.
There are 8 O pins (O0 to O7) and 11 R pins (R0 to R10). The instruction
set could actually support 15 R pins if needed and that would be simple
to add to the Verilog.

The R register is a pretty standard output only register. The pins can
be turned off individtually with the setr, rstr instructions using the
Y register to point to which pin to change.

The O register is a special one. Depending on the value of the status
register, the 8 bits are set based on the value of the A register.
The logic (using the tdo instruction) is like this:

    If flag_s is 0: O register = A;
    If flag_s is 1: O is treated as a 7 seg LED display and set to 0 to F
                    depending on the value of A.

Instructions
============

These are generated by tools/gen_opcodes.py using table/tms1000.cpp from
the naken_asm assembler source repo. Opcodes are sorted by their binary
representation to make it easier to implement in Verilog.
